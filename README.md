Introduction

**Welcome to the ACCULITE project!** 
This repository houses the codebase and documentation for ACCULITE, a cutting-edge digital health platform designed to bridge the healthcare gap in Africa. Our goal is to provide accessible, quality healthcare to underserved populations through innovative use of AI and IoT technologies.

**Problem Statement**
In many parts of Africa, access to quality healthcare is a significant challenge. Patients in rural and underserved urban areas face barriers such as a shortage of healthcare professionals, long travel distances, and inadequate infrastructure. This leads to delayed diagnoses, untreated conditions, and a general lack of continuous care, resulting in poor health outcomes.

**Solution Overview**
ACCULITE aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced AI and IoT technologies. Our platform connects patients with healthcare professionals, offers personalized care solutions, and ensures privacy and security. With ACCULITE, we strive to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and effective for all.

**Features**
_AI-Powered Chatbot_
Llama 3 Integration: Our AI chatbot, powered by Llama 3, assists patients with health-related queries, summarizes doctors' remarks, and converts text to speech for remote consultations.

_Text-to-Speech_: Ensures that patients in remote areas can receive voice consultations.
IoT Integration

_Real-Time Health Monitoring_: IoT devices monitor patients' health metrics and upload data to Firebase for continuous tracking.
Data Privacy: Ensures secure handling of sensitive health data.

_Appointment Scheduling_
_Easy Booking:_ Patients can book appointments with healthcare professionals through the platform.
SMS Notifications: Integrated with Africa's Talking for appointment confirmations and important health updates.

**Secure Communication**
Authentication and Authorization: Robust systems to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient data.
**Technical Stack**
Programming Languages: JavaScript (for frontend and backend development)
Frameworks/Libraries:
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
AI Models: Llama 3
IoT: Firebase for real-time data monitoring of the sensors that we had: MQ2 sensor, Pulse rate monitor sensor , ESP32 for connectivity and deploying data to the cloud.

**External Services**: 
Africa's Talking for SMS notifications
Installation and Setup
To set up the ACCULITE project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kennethkimosop/ACCULITE.git
cd accu-lite
Install Dependencies:

bash
**Copy code**
npm install
**Set Up Environment Variables:**
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

**Start the Development Server:**

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
**Run the Frontend:**

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm run dev

**Challenges Faced**
API Key Integration: We faced delays in accessing API keys for external services such as Africa's Talking and Llama 3. This was addressed by contacting support teams and using temporary keys for development.
Backend Configuration: Setting up the server to handle multiple endpoints and ensuring secure communication was challenging. 
We focused on troubleshooting, debugging, and thorough testing to ensure smooth functionality.
IoT Data Integration: Ensuring real-time data monitoring and secure data handling required extensive testing and validation.

**Future Plans**
Enhanced AI Capabilities: Further develop AI functionalities to offer more personalized care.
Expanded IoT Integration: Incorporate additional IoT devices to monitor a broader range of health metrics.
Scalability: Improve the platform's scalability to accommodate more users and regions.
User Feedback: Continuously refine the platform based on user feedback to enhance the user experience.
